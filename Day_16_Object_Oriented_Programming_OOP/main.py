# Procedural Programming => Complex

# Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
# How to use OOP?
# Waiter(Class):  Henry(Object)
# has(attributes):  is_holding_plate = True
#                   tables_responsible = [4, 5, 6]
# The things that they have are their attributes and these are usually modeled with variables.
# does(methods): def take_order(table, orrder):
#                    # takes order to chef
#                def take_payment(amount):
#                    # add money to restaurant
# The things that they can do are called methods and they are modeled by functions.

# Constructing Objects:
# You have the class which is normally written with the first letter of each word capitalized, which is known as Pascal case.
# car = CarBlueprint() => car is object and CarBlueprint is Class
